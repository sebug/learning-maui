# Learning MAUI
Now that I have read up on interacting with the Android, iOS APIs, I want
to actually integrate that stuff with MAUI. And to not pollute the work project,
I shall write a few sample projects here.

First, getting the necessary components:

       sudo dotnet workload install maui
       sudo dotnet workload install ios macos wasm-tools

Also I'll be developing on the mac so I need to [set up Visual Studio Code for MAUI development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?view=net-maui-8.0&tabs=visual-studio-code)
